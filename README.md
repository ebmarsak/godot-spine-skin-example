# godot-spine-skin-example
An example of how to set random skins on your Spine2D animations in Godot Engine.

- Godot Engine v3.4.3 compiled with [rayxuln's spine-runtime-for-godot](https://github.com/ebmarsak/spine-runtime-for-godot/tree/spine3.8).
> Code is depending on "spine3.8" branch. Haven't tested it with 4.0 but due to some major upgrades to software and API going from Spine v3.8 to Spine v4.0, this probably won't work on 4.0.
